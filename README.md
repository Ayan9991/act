## Usage

Once you have installed Act, you can start using it to run your GitHub Actions locally.

### Basic Command

To run your GitHub Actions, navigate to your repository directory in the terminal and use:

```bash
act
```

This command will execute the default workflow defined in your `.github/workflows` directory.

### Running Specific Events

You can also run specific events by specifying the event name:

```bash
act push
```

This command simulates a `push` event.

### Environment Variables

If your workflows require environment variables, you can set them directly in the command line:

```bash
act -e event.json
```

### Docker Support

Act uses Docker to run your workflows. Make sure you have Docker installed and running. You can customize the Docker image used by specifying the `--image` flag:
